## Notes:
1. Normalised state representation using the mean and variance of U(0,D) where D is the dimension of the square room. 
2. Fixed the heatmap visualisation tool accordingly so the critic is only scrutinised for normalised values. 
3. Use dropout with dropout probability of 1.0 on all networks.
